Question 1
There are three primary method of working with databases and data model when using the Entity Framework, 
namely: code first, model first and database first.

Code first requires programmers to first create the class of object what they wish to use. Visual Studio 
is able to inspect the class files and generates a database model from the code. This method is best if 
there is no pre-existing database.

The model first approach requires programmers to create a Visual Studio database model. Visual Studio will
then analysis the model and generate a database and the classes required to interact with the database. 
This method is best if there is no pre-existing database.

The database first approach requires a pre-existing database. The Visual Studio IDE is able to analyse the
database and generate a database mode. This model is then used to generate the classes required to 
interact with the database.

Question 2
Fields can either be marked an “ID” or “Key”. When marking a property as a primary key it can be called 
“ID” or “classnameID”. This indicate to Visual Studio that the property is a key. The “ID” key is 
preferred when marking a field as a primary key as “key” may be referring to a foreign key.

Question 3
The code first constructor can specify the database name. The connection string can be placed in the 
web.config/app.config file. The connection can also be made using the connection convention.

Question 4
All data in the database will be lost. Alter the database rather than drop it. This will preserve all data.

Question 5
The model can be further configured using the fluent API or by using data annotations. You are also able 
to create custom conventions.
